AbridgedMathsofQuadraticAddition.pdf is an abridged introduction to the math.

TwoPolynomial092319.csv data for populating graphdb.

Four cypher script text files.  
CreateDB loads the .csv.
Arithmetic will add two ^2 integers as pattern comprehension or otherwise return the quadratic polynomial representation of ^2.
UpdateWithQuartetNodes will extend graphDB with available quartet polynomial comprenension.  
ViewOfEvaluateQuartet inspects the new quartet.

TwoPolynomialGeneratorJarZip contains Java Jar file.
Run with two arguments:
.FileName.csv
.Index argument (An integer, the independent variable of a quadratic. So far, tested up to 1000).

note.json is zeppelin note GraphicZero exibiting properties of project polynomials.
note1.json is zeppelin note GraphicZero-TheQuadratics exibits output of the .jar file.

Both can be viewed using the zepplin notbook viewer at zepl.com.
